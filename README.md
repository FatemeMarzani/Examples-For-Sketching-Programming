# Examples-For-Sketching-Programming
In this project we try to write some codes examples to deal with Sketch.
#Sketching?
Sketch is a C-like programming language that has been developed by Solar Lezama and his group at MIT. In this programming language you can leave some pieces of code as a hole (??) which called Sketch and a program with this format is called a partial program. Synthesizer then replaces (??) with a constant. By assertions you can tell to your program about properties and constraints. In fact assertions force synthesizer to replace hole with a value that you expect. The efficient way is to write assertions inside the harness.

#Codes
We have tried to implement some sketching examples to find out how it works and if it is practicable in real projects or not?Then review codes in report.pdf file.
#Report
In this file, We review a summary about Sketch, how to install it and a review about its syntax. The codes and their results also reviwed in report.pdf file.
